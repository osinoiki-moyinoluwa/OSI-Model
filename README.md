This report analyzes a video explaining the OSI model. The video discusses what OSI model is, the uses of OSI model, what OSI model layers are, the 7 layers architecture of OSI model and, each of their specific functions.
</p>
<p>
The video explains and gives more insights on the Open system Interconnection Model using more of visuals which are more understandable. The video is important because it helps people who are into networking field; studying or working. The purpose of this report is to summarize the video and to help others who read this report to understand the OSI Model.
</p>
<p>
The video titled <strong>“OSI Models”</strong> was produced by the CISCO Config Channel. It is a 22-minute educational video published on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
The video makes us understand that OSI Model is a reference model that helps to communicate and transfer data across networks or from one network to another.
</p>
<p>
The video tells us that the Open System Interconnection Model was introduced in the year 1976 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was introduced to enable vendors to be able to connect and share files over different networks and computers.
</p>
<p>
The video tells us further that there are 7 layers of the OSI Model. The seven layers are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>💻 Application layer</li>
<li>🎨 Presentation layer</li>
<li>🔗 Session layer</li>
<li>🚚 Transfer layer</li>
<li>🌐 Network layer</li>
<li>🧱 Data link layer</li>
<li>🔌 Physical layer</li>
</ul>
<p>
The video said that for the OSI Model layers to be easily remembered, we can make use of a phrase which is <strong>"All People Seems To Need Data Processing"</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The video also made mention that a lot of questions are asked about the OSI Model but the most asked of all is whether the application layer is the first layer or the physical layer is the first layer? The speaker tells us that either can be the first layer, but it depends whether the network is a sender or a receiver. If a network is on the sender’s side the first layer will be the application layer and if a network is on the receiver’s side the first layer will be the physical layer.
</p>
<p>
The top three layers which are the application, presentation and session layer are classified as software layer because network applications are allowed to function in the three layers. The bottom three which are the network, data link and the physical layer are the hardware layer while the transfer layer which is at the middle serves as the connection between the software and the hardware layer.
</p>
<p>
The video talks about a story that will help us to understand the 7 layers of OSI Model easily. This story makes us understand that the application layer is where network applications i.e., google chrome, Firefox, and a file transferring application like Drop Box all work and exists. The application layer makes use of protocols like HTTPS, HTTP, FTP and SNMP.
</p>
<p>
Moving to the presentation layer, the story enlightens us that the function of the presentation layer is to convert data into bits, to encrypt data and to decrypt data.
</p>
<p>
As per the story, the session layer is to develop an end-to-end connection between a sender and the receiver. The video tells us further that the session layer can also be called the <strong>end-to-end layer</strong>. The session layer is to make sure the files or whatever is sent to the receiver is to be successful.
</p>
<p>
Next comes the transfer layer which is the heart of the OSI Model. The function of the transfer layer is to divide the file into segments to make it easier to be transferred.
</p>
<p>
The function of the network layer is to determine the path of whatever is being shared, routing and the logical addressing of the file. The logical address of a file is the IP address.
</p>
<p>
The data link layer is used to determine the flow of data and to control error and it is used to determine the physical address of the network. An error occurs when the receiving side like the PC collects data at 10mbps and the sender sends data at 100mbps, the data link layer makes use of the TCP (transmission control protocol) to enable the sender to send data at 10mphs. The UDP (user datagram protocol) is used to increase the flow of data.
</p>
<p>
The physical layer converts the data into bits and sends the data through any media available at the receiver’s side.
